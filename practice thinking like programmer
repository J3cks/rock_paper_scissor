UNDERSTANDING PROBLEM

ROCK PAPER SCISSOR!
Game that runs in external JS
A user vs computer game
After a user select via prompt computer will also select
If you win it will print out "You Win! (user selected) beats (computer selected)"
If you lose it will print out "You Lose! (computer selected) beats (user selected)"
The game is best of 5 and each score is tallied
If user reached 5 first user wins vice versa


PLAN/PSEUDOCODE

Browser prompts for user selection(rock, paper, scissor) selection must be case-INSENSITIVE
User selected will be saved in a variable
Computer will generate random selection
User and Computer selection will be compared
create a function in winning (rock beats scissor, paper beats rock, scissor beats paper)
score will be tallied for both user and computer
game will looped until either user of computer will reached 5 points 
if user reached 3 points game will prompt "YOU WIN!" 
if computer reached 3 points game will prompt "YOU LOSE!"


Breaking Encountered Problems

1. create a variable from the prompt choice of player and convert it lowercase, if following string selection is not from the list (rock paper scissor) prompt it back so the user can input the right selection.

2. function that randomize computer choice, we can use "Math.floor(Math.random()*array.length"
	to get random value within [rock, paper, scissor]

3. evaluate and compare playerChoice and computerChoice, make the playerChoice and computerChoice in single string variable, this will be easier to compare than two strings

4. for the scoring, create a variable scoreHuman and scorePc let the values to 0. upon winning or losing in the playround add +1 in the variable. this will add the score and use console.log to see the score for both the player and computer

5. create a loop that will loop the playRound for 6 times (6 times rather than 5 to account for ties in the game), if player/computer score reaches 3, break loop to end the game.
